# Notes

This is a simple notes web app.

## Features
- Angular 8
- PWA support

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
For production, use `npm run build:prod`

## Testing on http-server
Run `npm run start:dist` after building to test on http-server.

You can also use `npm run preprod` to do the build and run tasks in a single step.
